#remove lianas 
#ID-Aubrey, removing NAs 
#data exploration 
#distances - conditional statement? use actual distances 
#add column - intact or defaunated 
#gradient = cool :)

#into glm 
#dependent basal area independent veg_type, height, project.plot, distance, defaun/intact, 

#does distance change... frequency of vegetation types 

#plot level summaries 
#exploratory figures 

#sum of each plot how many unique species. 

#grouping size class distribution 
#histogram of sizes and make breaks based on data 

#remove anything less than 1.5 m in height 
#go with least heavily sampled plot 
#justify this filtering

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
